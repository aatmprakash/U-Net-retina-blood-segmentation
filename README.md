## Introduction

Retinal blood vessel segmentation plays a vital role in the diagnosis and monitoring of various retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Accurate segmentation of blood vessels can assist in the early detection of these diseases, leading to timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

This project aims to develop a deep learning model using the U-Net architecture to segment blood vessels from retinal images. The U-Net architecture is known for its symmetric encoder-decoder structure, which enables the extraction of high-level features and the precise localization of blood vessels in the image.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository. However, the code assumes that the dataset is organized in the following directory structure:

```
dataset/
    train/
        images/
            image_1.jpg
            image_2.jpg
            ...
        masks/
            mask_1.png
            mask_2.png
            ...
    val/
        images/
            image_1.jpg
            image_2.jpg
            ...
        masks/
            mask_1.png
            mask_2.png
            ...
```

The `train` directory contains the training images and their corresponding ground truth masks, while the `val` directory contains the validation images and masks. It is important to ensure that the image and mask pairs are aligned correctly.

## Model Architecture

The U-Net model is implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework. The architecture consists of an encoder path that captures contextual information and a decoder path that recovers spatial details. Skip connections are used to bridge the gap between the encoder and decoder, facilitating the fusion of low-level and high-level features.

The U-Net architecture has proven to be effective for semantic segmentation tasks, as it allows for precise delineation of blood vessels in retinal images.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aatmprakash/U-Net-retina-blood-segmentation.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your dataset in the appropriate directory structure, as described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

## Usage

Before running the code, ensure that you have installed the required dependencies and organized your dataset correctly.

To train the U-Net model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The trained model will be saved in the `saved_models` directory.

To evaluate the model on the validation set, run the following command:

```
python evaluate.py --model saved_models/unet.pth
```

Replace `unet.pth` with the appropriate checkpoint file name.

## Results

The evaluation script will provide quantitative metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the trained U-Net model. Additionally, visualizations of the predicted blood vessel segmentations can be generated for qualitative analysis.

The results obtained from the evaluation can help in understanding the model's ability to accurately segment blood vessels in retinal

 images.
